## Description

Rails application which uses advanced ActiveRecord queries combined with JSON:API endpoints to expose data from a typical sales database. 

The application was developed over the course of one week by [Adam Etzion](https://github.com/aetzion1) as means of learning how to develop a restful API.

## Project Board

A [project board](https://github.com/aetzion1/rails-engine/projects/1) was used to organize and manage my workflow over the course of the week.

## Setup

1. Fork and Clone the repo
2. Install gem packages: `bundle install`
3. Setup the database: `rails db:{create,migrate}`
4. Seed with test data, as needed: `rails db:seed`
5. Run test suite: `rspec`

## Versions

- Ruby 2.5.3

- Rails 5.2.4.5

## Learning Goals

* Expose an API
* Use serializers to format JSON responses
* Test API exposure
* Compose advanced ActiveRecord queries to analyze information stored in SQL databases
* Write basic SQL statements without the assistance of an ORM

## Requirements

The following [Technical Requirements](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine/requirements) were used to drive application development.
